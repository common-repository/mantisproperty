MantisProperty is a leading real estate and business broker CRM for brokers in Australia, New Zealand and the USA

Once this has been set up, your WordPress website will automatically display your listings from your MantisProperty account. Any enquiries made on listings in your site will then be emailed to you if you are on the gold plan or they will come in to the CRM and be processed as new enquiries if you are on the platinum or elite plans. If you are on the platinum or elite plan, new enquiries can be set to be emailed to you, sent via SMS and you can also set up auto responders and automated workflows to be triggered when a new enquiry comes in.
